# design-review

## purpose

Audit the live or implemented interface after build, not just the plan.

## when to use

- After a user-facing change ships or is close to release
- When the team wants a UI quality and product-taste audit

## inputs

- Implemented interface or screenshots
- `plan-design-review` notes in the sprint artifact
- `.ai/MEMORY/conventions.md` if visual principles exist

## procedure

1. Compare the delivered experience with the planned states and hierarchy.
2. Look for generic UI, weak emphasis, missing states, and copy friction.
3. Record design debt, quality risks, and recommended improvements in `.ai/LOCAL/PLANS/current-sprint.md`.

## outputs

- Design audit notes
- Missing-state list
- Product-taste and hierarchy recommendations

## escalation rules

- Escalate if the shipped UI contradicts the product wedge.
- Escalate if design quality issues are severe enough to block release.

## handoff rules

- Hand off to `start` for fixes or to `ship` if the interface is acceptable.
